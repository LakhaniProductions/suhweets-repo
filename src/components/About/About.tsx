              <p>
                Established in 2016, Suhweets began with a Tres Leches cake and
                grew into something beyond our wildest dreams. Since that first
                cake, founder and baker Suhei set off on a mission to learn as
                much as she could about creating delicious and exciting works of
                art. It wasn’t long before one birthday cake became two, and
                birthdays turned into weddings. Eventually, what began in our
                home kitchen led to the opening of our first storefront in 2025.
